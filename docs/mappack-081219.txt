Alien Arena Retro Map Pack
==========================

Thanks for downloading the retro Alien Arena map pack. This is a 
special collection of maps that were removed from the lineup 
prior to the Alien Arena 2009 release. No alterations were made 
to textures and lightning, apart from door teaming on a few of 
the maps and invisible changes required to make the maps
compatible with the CRX engine, the maps were left exactly as 
they were a decade ago. They have withstood the test of time 
and have long been community favourites, they are testament to 
how far Alien Arena has come in terms of technologies, theme
and design.
